### Hey Now!! ðŸ‘‹

I am a recent graduate of App Academy. I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer with an extensive background in the construction field. I am looking forward to applying my aptitude for project design and organization to building apps and services that make people's lives better.

I am currently working on polishing up my capstone project Sweetwafer which is an e-commerce site modelled after the Sweetwater website!
