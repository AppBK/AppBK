## Hey Now!! ðŸ‘‹

I am a recent graduate of App Academy. I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer ready to leverage my extensive background in project design and organization to build apps and services that make people's lives better.

I am currently working on polishing up my capstone project, <a href="https://sweetwafer.onrender.com">Sweetwafer</a>, which is an e-commerce site modeled after the Sweetwater website!
